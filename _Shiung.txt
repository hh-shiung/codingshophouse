TODO: Setup NewRelic to ping codingshophouse.herokuapp.com

Using New Relic APM
https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic
  $ heroku addons:create newrelic

Encountered errors
  ! No app specified
  ! Run this command from an app folder or specify which app to use with --app APP.

Thoughts:
  This might be due to the fact I'm working on the local directory instead of the remote Heroku repository.

Obstacle:
  Unable to locate Heroku app in personal Heroku account.
  Access denied error to the app codingshophouse after:
    heroku git:clone -a codingshophouse
